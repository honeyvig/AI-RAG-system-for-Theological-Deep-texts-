# AI-RAG-system-for-Theological-Deep-texts-
To create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using embeddings for an entire textbook—particularly theological texts that might be complex—there are a few steps involved. The goal here is to preprocess the textbook, generate embeddings for each chunk of text, and then use these embeddings to retrieve relevant information when queries are made, thereby augmenting the response generation process with highly relevant data.
Steps to Implement the RAG Pipeline with Embeddings for Theological Texts:

    Text Preprocessing:
        Split the textbook into manageable chunks (chapters, sections, or paragraphs depending on the text's length).
        Optionally, remove any unnecessary metadata, headers, or footnotes.

    Example code for text preprocessing:

from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

# Function to preprocess and split the text into chunks (sentences or paragraphs)
def preprocess_text(text, chunk_size=2000):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)  # Tokenizing text into sentences
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = ""
    for sentence in sentences:
        if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence) < chunk_size:
            current_chunk += sentence + " "
        else:
            chunks.append(current_chunk.strip())
            current_chunk = sentence + " "
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(current_chunk.strip())
    return chunks

# Sample usage
text = "Your long theological text here."
chunks = preprocess_text(text)
print(chunks[:2])  # Preview the first two chunks

Embeddings Generation:

    Use a model like OpenAI's GPT-3, GPT-4, or other embedding models (e.g., Sentence-BERT, OpenAI Embeddings, Hugging Face transformers) to generate embeddings for each chunk of the theological text.

Example code using OpenAI API to generate embeddings:

import openai
import numpy as np

openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

def generate_embeddings(text_chunks):
    embeddings = []
    for chunk in text_chunks:
        response = openai.Embedding.create(
            model="text-embedding-ada-002",  # You can use other models as well
            input=chunk
        )
        embeddings.append(np.array(response['data'][0]['embedding']))
    return embeddings

embeddings = generate_embeddings(chunks)

Indexing and Storing Embeddings:

    Store these embeddings in a vector database for easy retrieval. Options include FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, or Elasticsearch.

Example using FAISS to index embeddings:

import faiss

def create_faiss_index(embeddings):
    # Convert embeddings into a numpy array
    embeddings_np = np.array(embeddings).astype('float32')
    # Create a FAISS index (for dense vectors)
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings_np.shape[1])  # L2 distance for similarity search
    index.add(embeddings_np)  # Adding embeddings to the index
    return index

faiss_index = create_faiss_index(embeddings)

Query Handling and Retrieval:

    When a user submits a query, preprocess the query, generate its embedding, and use the vector index (FAISS) to retrieve the most relevant chunks from the theological text.

Example code to retrieve relevant documents based on a query:

def retrieve_relevant_docs(query, faiss_index, text_chunks, top_k=3):
    query_embedding = generate_embeddings([query])[0]
    query_embedding = np.array(query_embedding).reshape(1, -1).astype('float32')
    
    # Perform search for top_k nearest neighbors
    distances, indices = faiss_index.search(query_embedding, top_k)
    
    # Return the top_k most relevant documents
    relevant_docs = [text_chunks[i] for i in indices[0]]
    return relevant_docs

query = "What does the Bible say about salvation?"
relevant_docs = retrieve_relevant_docs(query, faiss_index, chunks)
print(relevant_docs)

RAG Generation:

    Once you retrieve the relevant text chunks, use a language model (e.g., GPT) to generate a response that combines the retrieved information with the query.

Example code to use OpenAI to generate a response:

    def generate_response(query, relevant_docs):
        context = " ".join(relevant_docs)
        prompt = f"Question: {query}\nContext: {context}\nAnswer:"
        
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="text-davinci-003",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=200
        )
        return response.choices[0].text.strip()

    response = generate_response(query, relevant_docs)
    print(response)

    Optimizations:
        Fine-tuning: You can fine-tune the language model for your specific use case, such as theological texts, to improve the relevance and quality of the answers.
        Model Choice: Depending on the complexity of your queries, you might consider using more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 or other specialized models in theology or philosophy).
        Retrieval Augmentation: You can augment the retrieval process by including additional context, such as external APIs or databases of theological knowledge, to improve the accuracy of the answers.

Conclusion:

By following this process, you can build an efficient RAG pipeline that analyzes deep theological texts, retrieves relevant information based on user queries, and generates accurate, contextually appropriate answers using AI-powered language models. The key components are:

    Preprocessing large texts.
    Generating embeddings for text chunks.
    Storing embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS).
    Efficient query handling using vector search.
    Answer generation via an AI model like GPT.

This pipeline is flexible enough to be adapted to other types of complex texts or domains, such as philosophical, legal, or scientific documents.
